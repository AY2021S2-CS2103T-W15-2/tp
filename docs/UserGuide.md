# ClientBook

ClientBook is an application for managing client contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you are an insurance agent who can type fast, ClientBook can help _you_ accomplish your client management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Why ClientBook?

ClientBook is designed for insurance agents who are always on the go. We understand the **pain** and **inconvenience** of having to **navigate around 
your screen without a mouse** while you are out meeting a client, as well as the **limitations of a laptop's battery life**.<br>

Thus, ClientBook is born!<br>

Requiring **minimal interactions with your cursor**, ClientBook still allows you to complete essential contact management 
tasks with our minimal yet essential set of contact management features.<br> 

Consisting of only the **most necessary features** any good insurance agent will need while on the go, ClientBook is extremely easy on your laptop's battery!

If you are a new user, you can start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section. 
If you are an experienced user, we have provided a convenient [Summary of Commands](#summary-of-commands) at the end of this user guide.


## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   * To check if you have this installed or for instructions on how to install, refer to our FAQ [here](#FAQ).

1. Download the latest `clientbook.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.2).
1. Copy the file to the folder (we will be referring to this folder as the _home folder_) where you want to store the ClientBook application and your client information.

1. Double-click the downloaded `clientbook.jar` file in your home folder to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. 
   * Alternatively, for those who are tech-savvy, you can launch the application via Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in Mac OS/Linux using the following command: `java -jar clientbook.jar`. 
   * Note how the app contains some sample data.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* **Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters** to be supplied by the user. 
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, NAME is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.


* **Items in square brackets are optional**. 
  * e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.


* **Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times**. 
  * e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used 0 or more times, `t/basic`, `t/basic t/lifeinsurance` etc.


* **Parameters can be in any order**. 
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken. 
  * e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.


* **Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters** (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) **will be ignored**. 
  * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  

* Attributes in the form `-identifier` will be referred to as flags, while attributes in the form `identifier/` will be referred to as prefixes.
  * e.g. for the `name` attribute, its flag would be `-n`, while its prefix would be `n/`.

* Edits the client at the specified `INDEX`.
    * `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list.

<br><br>

  
### `find`: Search for client contact based on keywords

**Purpose**: Finds and displays all clients whose field (name, phone, email, address, tags, insurance policy) contains any of the given keywords.
Optional flags can be added to show the list of matched clients with only the specified attributes.

**Format**: `find FLAG/KEYWORD [& MORE_KEYWORDS] [-ATTRIBUTES]…​`

* The search is **case-insensitive**. 
  * E.g. hans will match Hans.
* The **order of the keywords does not matter**.
* Only one `FLAG` can be used in each find command.
  * `FLAG` uses the identifier of each attribute to help the program identify which attribute you are referring to.
  * For more information about the identifiers for each attribute, refer to [What information can we store for each client contact?](#what-information-can-we-store-for-each-client-contact).
* The delimiter `&` between keywords allows you to search for Clients using multiple keywords.
  * E.g. `Aaron & Tan` will return all persons with either `Aaron` or `Tan` in their names.
* Without the use of delimiter `&`, all keywords following the `FLAG` will be used in the search. 
  * E.g. `Aaron Tan` will only return persons with `Aaron Tan` in their names.
* Clients with matching keywords in the chosen field will be returned. 
  * E.g. `Hans & Bo` will return person `Hans Sum` and `Bo Yang`.
* Similar to the [`list`](#list-list-all-clients) command, optional attributes can be added to show only certain attributes in the search result.
  * E.g. `-p` filters phone number information of the listed clients.
    
**Examples**:
* Find `Alex David` and `Alex Yeoh`.
  * `find n/alex`

    ![find alex](images/find-alex.png)

* Find `Alex David`.
  * `find n/alex david`
  
    ![find_alex_david](images/find_alex_david.png)
  
* Find `Alex David`, `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`.
  * `find n/alex & david`
  
    ![find_alex_&_david](images/find-alex-&-david.png)

* Find all persons whose address contains `geylang`.
  * `find a/geylang` - returns `Alex Yeoh` whose address is `Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40`

    ![find by address](images/find-by-address.png)

* Find the email and phone number of all persons whose names contain `alex` and `david`.
  * `find n/alex & david -e -p`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:exclamation: **Note**: After setting a password, ClientBook can only be launched through Command Prompt or Terminal.

[keyboard shortcuts](#summary-of-keyboard-shortcuts) which when pressed, will fill in the command keyword for you.

### Saving data

**Purpose**: ClientBook saves its data to a file in the home folder automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br><br>


### Editing data file

**Purpose**: ClientBook saves its data as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/clientbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

* The data file is stored in a zip file inside the `data` folder in the same folder. 
* If you previously set a `lock` for ClientBook, the zip folder can be unzipped with that same password.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:exclamation: **Caution**:
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, **all your data will be lost** at the next run.
